# Engine-3D

## Overview
* Game Engine called Engine3D.
* Rendering-API agnostic engine that'll soon be able to support Vulkan, DirectX, and even Metal
* Platform-agnostic engine that'll support both Windows, Linux, and Mac.

## Engines Editor
* Editor's current design and layout
* User can add/remove components from entities.
* User can attach different components to entities. (Static, Dynamic)
* Playing/Stopping scenes
* Native File Dialogs
* Serializer/Deserializer for loading/saving current scenes.
* Is where the serialization/deserialization code is located for handling loading/saving different scenes, `https://github.com/SpinnerX/Game_Engine/blob/main/GameEngine/include/GameEngine/Scene/SceneSerializer.cpp`.

## UI Editor Usage

## Projects Built using Engine3D

### Rocket-Game
* The game is like the mini rocket mode in Geometry Dash.
* Using the 2D renderer built in Engine3D showcases the capabilities of the engine.
* Link to that repo for Rocket-Game `https://github.com/SpinnerX/Rocket-Game`
