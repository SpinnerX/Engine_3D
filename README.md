# Game Engine

### Overview
* Developing a 3D Game Engine using OpenGL/GLFW rendering APIs
* The goal for the engine is to make games, but hopefully, get to the point of being able to process audio and digital processing.
* 2D/3D game development for hoping to take into game jams.

### Engines Editor Showcase
* At the current progression of developing the engine.
* Earlier in the development, added a profiler to monitor the function's runtime.
* The editor can add/remove entities into the scene, including adding/removing components from entities.
* Serializing/Deserializing enabling the users to load/save scenes into the editor.

### Rocket Game built with this Game Engine
* Developed a rocket game kind of similar to the one in Geometry Dash where you have a rocket that needs to avoid obstacles
* This was simply to showcase the use of this Game Engine, that I was developing
* This is the GitHub link to that repo for Rocket-Game `https://github.com/SpinnerX/Rocket-Game`
