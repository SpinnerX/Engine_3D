### Game Engine

## Overview
- Currently developing a 3D game engine in C++ using OpenGL rendering API's.
- Goal is to allow to create interfaces and other internal interfaces allowing users to use what they pay for.
- Essentially this will be containing interfaces, and users can implement these interfaces as they see fit.
- Implementations are able to be platform specific depending on the OS the user is developing on


### Rocket Game with Game Engine
* Developed a rocket game kind of similar to the one in Geometry Dash where you have a rocket that needs to avoid obstacles
* This was simply to showcase the use of this Game Engine, that I was developing
* This is the github link to that repo for Rocket-Game `https://github.com/SpinnerX/Rocket-Game`
