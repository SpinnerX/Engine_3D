# Engine-3D

## Overview
* Creating Engine3D from scratch using the raw OpenGL API, for understanding further Computer Graphics, and Rendering Architecture
* The purpose for this engine, eventually is to be a Rendering-API agnostic engine that'll soon be able to support Vulkan, DirectX, and even Metal
* Allowing to build creative projects through this engine. While also giving users to use this as an API as well as having an easier setup.
* Here are the philosophies behind the codebase is to be fast, scalable, and be platform-specific.
  * Platform-specific meaning you use what you only need.

## UI Editor
* Engine3D's interactive built-in UI Editor
* Interactive UI elements for dealing with multiple scenes
* Managing entities, and assets
* Playing active scenes through the editor
* Creating a new scene, loading, and saving different scenes through serialization.

### Shadows, Light, Diffuse Reflections
* Will be adding in ray tracing, lighting effects
* This is ray tracing and using PCG hashing to minimize the noise we see in each frame.

## Projects using Engine3D

### Particle System
* Manually using Engine3D in its early stages to develop a particle system.
* Used for the `Rocket-Game`for giving it the propeller effects.

### Rocket-Game
* Engine3D will have support for building 2D and 3D games.
* Building a 2D game called "Rocket-Game", where mechanics represent both the flappy bird and the flying mode in geometry dash. \
* Link to that repo for Rocket-Game `https://github.com/SpinnerX/Rocket-Game`
