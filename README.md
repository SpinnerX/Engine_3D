### Game Engine

### Overview
- Currently developing a 3D game engine in C++ using OpenGL rendering API's.
- Goal is to allow to create interfaces and other internal interfaces allowing users to use what they pay for.
- Essentially this will be containing interfaces, and users can implement these interfaces as they see fit.
- Implementations are able to be platform specific depending on the OS the user is developing on
